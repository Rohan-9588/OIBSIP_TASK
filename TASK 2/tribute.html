                About the Sachin Sir   
            </h1>  
             <p>  
                ☛ Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (born 24 April 1973) is an Indian former international cricketer who captained the Indian national team.<br><br>  
                ☛ Sachin Tendulkar is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.<br><br>  
                ☛ He is the all-time highest run-scorer in both ODI and Test cricket with more than 18000 runs and 15000 runs respectively in total. He also holds the record for receiving the most man-of-the-match awards in international cricket.<br><br>  
                ☛ Raj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989, after one first class season. The Indian selection committee had shown interest in selecting Tendulkar for the tour of the West Indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career. 
       <br><br> ☛ Tendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful. When Tendulkar took over as captain in 1996, it was with huge hopes and expectations. However, by 1997 the team was performing poorly. Azharuddin was credited with saying "Nahin jeetega! Chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin hai!"    
       <br><br> ☛ Tendulkar was made the Icon player and captain for his home side, the Mumbai Indians in the inaugural Indian Premier League Twenty20 competition in 2008.
       <br><br> ☛ In 2010 edition of Indian Premier League, Mumbai Indians reached the final of the tournament. Tendulkar made 618 runs in 14 innings during the tournament, breaking Shaun Marsh's record of most runs in an IPL season. He was declared player of the tournament for his performance during the season. He also won Best Batsman and Best Captain awards at 2010 IPL Awards ceremony. Sachin has scored more than 500 runs in IPL in two different seasons as a captain.
       <br><br> ☛ Tendulkar is the leading run scorer in Tests, with 15,921 runs, as well as in One-Day Internationals, with 18,426 runs.[27] He is the only player to score more than 30,000 runs in all forms of international cricket (Tests, ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals)
       <br><br> ☛ He also holds the record of the highest number of centuries in both Tests (51) and ODIs (49) as well as in Tests and ODIs combined (100). On 16 March 2012, Tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred. It came against Bangladesh in the league matches of Asia Cup 2012.
       <br><br> ☛ Sachin Tendulkar‘s highest score in ODI cricket is an innings of an unbeaten 200 runs, which he scored against South Africa on February 24, 2010. He is the first-ever cricketer who went on to breach the elusive 200-run mark in one-day international cricket. It was the second ODI of the three-match series between the two teams, and the game was played at Gwalior. However, not many were aware that history would be created that day.
